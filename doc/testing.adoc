== Prerequisites

https://pester.dev/docs/quick-start[Pester 5.6] is used for unit tests in this project. Please note that Windows is shipped
with much older version of Pester. For installation instructions follow the
https://pester.dev/docs/introduction/installation[official guide].

== Running tests

To run the whole test suite (all available tests) with code coverage, use the link:../pester.ps1[`pester.ps1`] script:

[source,shell]
----
pwsh .\pester.ps1
----

Otherwise, you can run individual tests in terminal by following the instructions in
https://pester.dev/docs/quick-start[Pester quick start guide].

== Testing conventions

- All tests are located in the link:../tests/[tests] directory or its subdirectories.
- All test files are following the naming convention `*.Tests.ps1`.
- Coverage report is available at `./coverage/coverage.xml` (when you run the full test suite, of course);
