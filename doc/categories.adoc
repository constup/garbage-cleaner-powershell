== Introduction

Categories are implemented in order to offer users a way to fine tune their cleaning process, while keeping it simple
for other users to reuse the same cleaning rules. This is why:

[IMPORTANT]
====
The list of available categories is *static* and defined in the constUP Garbage Cleaner's
link:../cleanup-list.schema.json[JSON schema].
====

If none of the categories are suitable for your cleanup rule, you can either:

1. Create an issue and request for a category to be included in the JSON schema. Please make sure to read and understand
link:contributing.adoc[Contribution guidelines] before opening an
https://github.com/constup/garbage-cleaner/issues[issue].

2. Use `custom_category` field instead.
